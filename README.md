## Projects

### [Handwritten Text Recognition (English Language)](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/HTR)
**Technologies and Approaches:**  
Python, GIT, GH Actions, Hugging Face, PyTorch, Transformer models, YOLO, REST API, Docker, Next.js, TypeScript

- Researched existing studies of handwritten text recognition models.
- Collected and processed data from over 8 different open-source datasets.  
  Processing included:
  - Annotations for YOLO (separate line and word detection models).
  - Parsing .xml files and optimizing annotations.
- Utilized transformer-based recognition models: GPT-2 and DTrOCR.
- Developed and containerized (Docker) an API.  
  Infrastructure was built on AWS using Terraform.  
- Used GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- The project is under development; the final goal is to integrate the API with a website.  

  **Repository Links:**
  - [Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/htr-frontend)
  - [API (Research/Dev/Main)](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/HTR)

### [Satellite (Sentinel-2) image matching](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/DS_Internship/tree/main/CV)
#### [Demo](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/DS_Internship/blob/main/CV/notebooks/inference_script_demo.ipynb) 

- While working on this project - gained experience with basic preprocessing of satellite imagery, 
  experience of working with Sentinel-2 API, used existing models like LightGlue, SuperGlue as matchers,
  SuperPoint - as extractor of keypoints on image.
- Also customized founders repositories to obtain full tuning pipeline for extractor, matcher.
  Created datasets for this purpose.

### [Named Entity Recognition NER](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/DS_Internship/tree/main/NLP)
#### [Demo](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/DS_Internship/blob/main/NLP/notebooks/demo_and_test_reports.ipynb) 

- Gained experience of using Hugging Face, working with NER task, prompt-engineering for LLM.
- Worked on BERT fine-tuning using custom synthetic generated dataset of mountain names.
- Using Llama - generated 20 thousand of sentences using more than 2000 different mountain names.
Used custom algorithm to label this sentences considering that mountain names was wrapped in special symbols.
- Created test dataset using manual labelling of real-world sentences from Reddit.

### [Implementation of Machine Learning Architectures](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/ml-implementations)

- Implemented architectures for computer vision and deep learning:
  - YOLO, UNET, MobileNet, Inception, ResNet, Vision Transformer.
- **Other models:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine.
- **Additional work:** Clustering and methods for solving systems of linear equations (SLEs).

### [Implementation of Computer Vision techniques](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/opencv_projects)
**Technologies and Approaches:**  
C++, OpenCV

- Implemented camera calibation using chessboard pattern (custom data, camera). 
- Currently working on image stitching implementation.

---

### Other Projects
**Technologies and Approaches:**  
Bash, Python, Airflow, Docker

- **Data Engineering:** A simple ETL pipeline using Python + Airflow.  
  _(project currently inactive)_  
- **Shell scripts:** Automated backup creation.
- **Personal Resume Website:** Planning to upgrade it using Next.js + TypeScript.

### [Classic Algorithms + SQL](https://leetcode.com/sskyisthelimit/)
On the **LeetCode** platform, I have solved **126 problems**, including:

- **Easy level:** 87 problems
- **Medium level:** 35 problems  
- **Hard level:** 4 problems  

Most of these problems were solved **two years ago** when I first started learning Python.  
Currently, I am actively revisiting algorithms to prepare for interviews.  
I am focusing on **medium** and **hard-level problems** to improve my algorithmic thinking.
