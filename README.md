## Projects

### [Handwritten Text Recognition (English Language)](https://github.com/sskyisthelimit/HTR)
**Technologies and Approaches:**  
Python, GIT, GH Actions, Hugging Face, PyTorch, Transformer models, YOLO, REST API, Docker, Next.js, TypeScript

- Researched existing studies of handwritten text recognition models.
- Collected and processed data from over 8 different open-source datasets.  
  Processing included:
  - Annotations for YOLO (line and word detection models).
  - Parsing .xml files and optimizing annotations.
- Utilized transformer-based recognition models: GPT-2 and DTrOCR.
- Developed and containerized (Docker) an API.  
  Infrastructure was built on AWS using Terraform.  
- Used GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- The project is under development; the final goal is to integrate the API with a website.

### [Classic Algorithms + SQL](https://leetcode.com/sskyisthelimit/)
On the **LeetCode** platform, I have solved **126 problems**, including:

- **Easy level:** 87 problems
- **Medium level:** 35 problems  
- **Hard level:** 4 problems  

Most of these problems were solved **two years ago** when I first started learning Python.  
Currently, I am actively revisiting algorithms to prepare for interviews.  
I am focusing on **medium** and **hard-level problems** to improve my algorithmic thinking.
